## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This project accepts structured user input to create classes corresponding to the stages of MVP development.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
The MVP ladder, developmental stages of minimum viable products on a categorical level, is a way to identify where a given idea/ product is and to direct further development or structure thinking about next steps. This automation makes that process slightly simpler.
## This project uses only python built-in functions and data types.


## This project does not require any special setup steps.

## The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:
